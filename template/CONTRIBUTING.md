Contributions are welcome. Please open a Pull Request against the `main` branch.

## Getting started

This project uses [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Install the project and
its development dependencies with

```sh
uv sync
```

If you use [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/), drop a one-line `.envrc` in the
repository root so the virtualenv activates on `cd`:

```sh
echo 'use uv' > .envrc && direnv allow
```

(`.envrc` is intentionally not tracked — it's local to your machine.)

A [`justfile`](justfile) provides the common tasks. Run everything with

```sh
just
```

or individually:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `just lint` | `ruff format`, `marimo check --fix`, `ruff check --fix`, `marimo check --strict` |
| `just lint-check` | Non-mutating variant, used by CI |
| `just check-canonical` | Asserts the example notebooks are in marimo's canonical form |
| `just check-examples` | Runs the example notebooks — the only step that executes cells |
| `just typecheck` | `pyright` |
| `just test` | `pytest` |
| `just test-cov` | `pytest` with coverage, failing under 90% |
| `just doctest` | Run the doctest examples in `src/` |
| `just docs` | Export the example notebooks, then `zensical build` |
| `just docs-serve` | The same, with a live-reloading local server |

If you don't have `just` on your PATH, prefix with `uv run`, e.g.
`uv run just test`.

Consider installing [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) so that the hooks in
[`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](.pre-commit-config.yaml) run before each commit:

```sh
uv tool install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

## Documentation

The documentation is built with [Zensical](https://zensical.org/) from the
Markdown in `docs/`, plus an API reference generated from docstrings by
[mkdocstrings](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/).

`docs/example.md` is **generated** — it is exported from
`examples/notebook.py` (a [marimo](https://marimo.io/) notebook) by
`just docs`, with cell outputs rendered. Edit the notebook, not the Markdown:

```sh
marimo edit examples/notebook.py
```

Preview the site locally with `just docs-serve`.

## Style

- Ruff enforces formatting and lint; see `[tool.ruff]` in `pyproject.toml`.
- Public functions and classes in `src/` need docstrings, in
  [Google style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings).
  Tests, scripts and examples are exempt.
- Type annotations are expected; `pyright` runs over `src/` and `tests/`.
